## machine learning Map
 - [I am working on a machine learning problem and looking to use Sklearn and not sure what model you should use, refer to the sklearn machine learning map: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html
 
  
## Observation from this project:
- 1. If we have structured data, used ensemble methods
- 2. If we have unstructured data, use deep learning or transfer learning
